# actionmc-mod
Companion Minecraft mod to the ActionMC server

Adds simple features such as a service status check and built-in skin server compatibility.

Tested and confirmed to work on its own and with OptiFine 1.2.5 HD U C7 (requires deletion of nl.class).
Compatibility with Nodus will be added eventually.

## Compiling
MCP 6.2 is required to compile this. It should be placed in a directory named `mcp62` or nothing will work.

To compile, simply run `compile.sh` with Bash on a typical GNU/Linux distribution. WSL is untested.
